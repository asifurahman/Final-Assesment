            <h2>About Carrum</h2>
            <p>
                Carrum, also known as "Carrom" or "Karom," is a captivating board game that has roots tracing back to South Asia, particularly India. Its popularity has spread far beyond its place of origin, making it a beloved pastime around the world. Carrum is known for its simplicity, yet its gameplay requires a blend of strategic thinking, precision, and finesse.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is played on a square wooden board with four corner pockets and is typically enjoyed by two to four players. The objective is to pocket your assigned color of pieces using a striker, employing a combination of skillful shots and calculated angles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carrum is not only a game of precision but also a test of strategy. Players need to carefully plan their moves, considering not only how to pocket their own pieces but also how to prevent opponents from doing the same. The interaction of pieces on the board adds an element of complexity that keeps players engaged and challenged.

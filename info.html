        <h2>Rules of Carrum</h2>
        <p>Carrum is played on a round board divided into concentric rings, with pieces placed on the intersections. Players take turns rolling dice and moving their pieces according to the roll. The goal is to eliminate your opponent's pieces or strategically block their movements.</p>
        <p>Each piece moves a specific number of spaces based on the dice roll. Pieces can capture opponents' pieces by landing on their intersections, removing them from the board. The game requires a delicate balance of offense and defense, combined with strategic planning.</p>
